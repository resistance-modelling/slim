Model Overview
==============

SLIM is a *probabilistic*, *statistical* epidemiological simulator. Compared to IBM approaches
we simulate overall populations and perform statistical operations on top of them rather than
emulating individual louse or fish.

At the same time, SLIM is also a *game* simulator where each agent (farmers) seeks to maximise
their own profit and may choose to collaborate or defect (more on this later), which treatment to apply and so on.

So where does this agent differ from the others? The difference lies in the explicit encoding
of genomic effects into the evolution of the pandemic. Treatments may encourage resistant
traits to proliferate and thus make the former less and less effective at each cycle.

.. note::
   This section assumes you have some basic knowledge of salmon aquaculture. If
   you don't we suggest having a look at :ref:`Rationale` or [1]_ first.

The project models an environment in which an :py:class:`slim.Simulator.Organisation` of salmon farmers - which reside
and operate on the same *loch* - run their own :py:class:`slim.Farm.Farm` s which are in turn divided into
:py:class:`slim.Cage.Cage` s.

A *cage* is the physical location of salmons. Initially all cages within the same farm are filled
with *smolts* which are then left to grow up and harvested after 1.5-2 years.

Sea lice stay in the reservoir and, either thanks to water currents or wild salmon, leak into
salmon cages. Once they find a host to attach to they evolve from *recruitment* or *copepopid* to
*chalimus* and beyond. SLIM models cage-specific, stage-specific lice populations and assumes concentration
and pollution effects as farms are operative for long periods of time.

As lice attach to fish they cause a number of diseases which incur in fish death.
If the *lice aggregation* ratio exceeds a given threshold treatment must be performed. However,
other farmers not reaching that threshold may be faring better and opt to defect.

Whether egoism backfires or not is not an easy question as it
depends on the current stage of the epidemics, lake pollution and how water currents work in the specific simulation
environment.

Note that farmers are individual agents, meaning they have full freedom to open the cages in
any season they prefer and whenever to treat, and also on which treatment to apply.

   The exact formulae behind this are documented in our paper. When it comes out please check it out!

Sea Lice Population
*******************

Our model is built on 3 main papers [#Aldrin17]_ [#Cox17]_ [#Jensen17]_:

Just like in [#Aldrin17]_, we model the lice lifecycle as a compartmentalised model of 6 stages: *recruitment* (R),
*copepopids* (CO), *chalimus* (CH), *preadults* (PA) and *adults*, the latter divided in males (AM) and females (AF).
Differently from [#Aldrin17]_ we omit the explicit age encoding but rather explicitly group the population
by its genotype. Nevertheless, the age distribution can be simulated at will via
:py:meth:`slim.Cage.Cage.get_stage_ages_distrib`.

This is modelled by the :py:class:`slim.LicePopulation.GenoDistrib` class. A genotype distribution
is, ultimately, a discretised dictionary with where the keys are allele combinations (see
:py:class:`slim.LicePopulation.GenoDistrib.Alleles`) and the values are the actual number of lice in that group.

In a similar way to [#Aldrin17]_, each day we estimate how many lice die or evolve at every stage.

All stages are subject to the following:

* background mortality;
* treatment-induced mortality;
* cleaner fish mortality (*not yet implemented*);
* evolution (can be either additive from the previous stage or subtractive to the successive stage);
* age mortality (i.e. lice that could not evolve will die).

In all stages but AM or AF lice can evolve. Evolution from PA will result in roughly 50% split between AM and AF.

Treatment
*********

TODO: explain the treatments used.

Reproduction
************

During mating those alleles are recombined according to a Mendelian approach. The number of
reproduction events is calculated on the *estimated* number of matings that can happen on a single
host. We assume a monogamist scenario in which one female lice can mate with only one male lice
before being fecundated. As in [#Cox17]_ we estimate such number via a negative multinomial
distribution.

The number of produced eggs is defined in a similar way to [#Aldrin17]_ and follows a power law
parametrised on the (virtual) age distribution.

TODO: expand on this.
